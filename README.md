This is a simple Stone Paper Scissors game (also called Rock Paper Scissors) made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fun browser-based game where you can play against the computer. You just have to choose between Stone, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer will make a random choice. Based on the game rules, it will show whether you win, lose, or draw. The design is clean and responsive, and the game keeps track of the score as you play. It is a great beginner-level project to understand basic web development, including page structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript). This project can be improved further by adding sound effects, animations, or even a multiplayer option.
